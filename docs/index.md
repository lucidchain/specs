# Lucid Chain Wizard Specification

The goal of the [Lucid Chain Wizard Specification](./Specification.md) is to promote a description language for service chain modeling supporting faceted and state types and other service chain characteristics. The blueprint described here describes the format to define service chains and in a common and neutral technological way.

We also provide some examples which define the service chain models in order to illustrate the main concepts of the specification.
