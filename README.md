# Lucid Chain Wizard Specification

The goal of the [Lucid Chain Wizard Specification](./Specification.md) is to promote a description language for service chain modeling supporting faceted and state types and other service chain characteristics. The blueprint described here describes the format to define service chains and in a common and neutral technological way.

We also provide some examples which define the service chain models in order to illustrate the main concepts of the specification.

To run it locally just run these commands:

```bin/bash
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve
```
