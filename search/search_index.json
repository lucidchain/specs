Revision History Version Date Notes 1.0 2025 Initial service chain modeling version. Introduction Lucid Chain Wizard provides a service chain modeling language that is capable of specify many service chains configurations such as its type or TTO calculus. LCW helps to import and export service chains from ITop and Redmine, and it can also give some detailed metrics about SLA compliance. In this page we will describe this language. What is a service chain A service chain is a set of two or more organizations that are related to each other through at least one service, in which a series of agreements are involved through an SLA. In this SLA we can specify TTO and TTR values. Once we have this structure, we can represent it in a yaml file and use it in ITop or Redmine using Lucid Chain WIzard. Before we start introducing the yaml structure and all the possible options that it provides, we are going to describe some concepts: Incident/request/issue: It is a need reported by a customer. It must be handled by an organization following its repective SLA rules. For us every term such as incident, service request, user request and so on will be treated and refered as \"issue\" . TTO: It means Time To Ownership. It is the time it takes for a team or individual to be assigned to an issue after it has been created or its state changed. TTR: It means Time To Resolve. It is the time it takes for an issue to be closed since it has been assigned to someone or a team. Specification A service chain model description is a YAML document with following structure. Note that primitive data types in the service chain model specification are based on the types supported by the JSON-Schema Draft 4 . Figure 1: SCModel UML Representation. As you can see in Figure 1, SCModel specifications is complex. The UML has different colors to make it easier to understand each part: Grey: This color is used to represent the whole service chain. Purple: This color is used to represent all Enums in SCModel notation. Blue: This color is used to represent all the parts related with SCModel service chain configuration . Light orange: This color is used to represent all the parts related with organizations , including teams, services and people. Pink: This color is used to represent all the parts related with SLAs and objectives. Type faceted chains In service chains with type faceted we have a simplified incident management. In this type of service chains the customer created an issue for its provier. The issue is assigned to a team and later to a person. When this happens, TTO is calculated as the time between its creation and its asignation. Once TTO is calculated, we start to count TTR until the issue has been resolved. Although the issues have states, they are always associated with the same service. If during the issue management the provider organization has to pass the resposability to one of its providers, a new issue between them must be created. In these cases we can close or pause the original issue. This way of managing issues makes a bit difficult tracking whether the first provider or any of its providers are fullfiling the SLAs or not. However, it is simpler and easier to understand. Faceted chains usually are usefull when there are no third party services interacting with the client. We can represent faceted service chains as a directed graph, where the edges always represent a new issue creation. Figure 2: Graph representation of a service chain type faceted chain. Type state chains In type state service chains issue management is more complex but it is more efficent to detect who is not passing SLAs. In type state, when an issue is created, it has an state, which is related to just one service. In case this service needs to pass the responsability to another, it does it using the same issue, but changing its state. TTO is calculated as the sum of time the issue is not assigned to an user or a team. In case ownership-type is state, TTO is the sum of the times between the issue changes to a new state until is assigned to a person. In case ownership-type is state+team, it is calculated as the sum of the times between the issue is assigned to a new team until is assigned to a person. In type state service chains we must define initial and terminal services, because we can represent this chains as bidirectional graphs. At this point, the only way to determine where we can start or end the process is defining this flow. Here the edges means a issue changing its state. We also need to define an initial SLA, because issue creation is a special moment that just can be done once. Figure 3: Graph representation of a service chain type state chain. Yaml structure Field name Field type Required/Optional Description context Context Required Service chain context and general configuration orgs Organization Required List of all organizations including its services and teams sla SLA Required List of all SLAs involved in the service chain and its guarantees. x-redmine-profiles-permissions RedmineProfilePermissionsObject Optional List of all privileges and properties from redmine profiles defined in the chain. NOTE: It is not allowed to include the prefix \" DEPRECATED \" in any name or value for any property. Yaml structure example context: Context orgs: Organization[] sla: SLA[] Context This section of the yaml defines the service chain configuration. It is essential in order to understand how the chain works and some extra information. Context Field name Field type Required/Optional Description id Number Required Unique identifier for the service chain. version Number Required Version number of the context. config Configuration Required Configuration details of the service chain. chain-name String Optional Name of the service chain. It is highly recommended to include that property. description String Optional Description of the service chain.

By default its value is 'state' It is not optional if chain type is state. initial-sla String Optional It is the name of the initial SLA assigned to the service chain. It will be the SLA taken into account when a new issue is created and it has not changed its state. It is not optional if chain type is state. Configuration type state example service-chain-type: \"state\" initial: ServiceStateObject[] terminal: ServiceStateObject[] ownership-type: \"state+team\" initial-sla: \"REVIEW_SHIP_SLA\" x-redmine-custom-fields: RedmineCustomFieldObject[] Configuration type faceted example service-chain-type: faceted ServiceChainType Value Description state Represents type state chains. It means that issues change its states instead of being closed/stopped when it is necessary to contact another service in order to solve them. faceted Represents type faceted chains. It means that issues closed/stopped and a new issue is created when it is necessary to contact another service in order to solve them. ServiceStateObject Field name Field type Required/Optional Description service String Required It is the name of the service. Use \"*\" when you want to include all services. states String[] Required List of states associated with the service. This states will be terminal or initial, and that means they have a special meaning because they start or end the flow. ServiceStateObject example service: \"Review ship\" states: - \"STUDYING\" - \"DRAFT\" This means that the service with the name \"Review ship\" has 2 terminal or initial states (depending on where this ServiceStateObject is). Theese states are \"STUDYING\" and \"DRAFT\".

By default its value is false . Note that this property is only available if field_format is list x-redmine-tickets-types TicketTypeEnum[] Optional List of Redmine ticket types whose issues will have this custom values. If this property is not present, LCW assumes its for all ticket types.

OwnershipType This property default value is 'state'. It has really strong implications in TTO and TTR calculations, which implies that it is common for all issues created. Value Description state Represents ownership-type state. It means that TTO is calculated as the sum of the times between each change of state and the moment the issue is assigned to a person. TTR is calculated as the sum of the times between each user assignation and each change of state. state+team Represents ownership-type state+team. It means that TTO is calculated as the sum of the times between each group assignation and the moment the issue is assigned to a person.

In this page we will describe this language.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Specification/#what-is-a-service-chain","text":"A service chain is a set of two or more organizations that are related to each other through at least one service, in which a series of agreements are involved through an SLA. In this SLA we can specify TTO and TTR values. Once we have this structure, we can represent it in a yaml file and use it in ITop or Redmine using Lucid Chain WIzard. Before we start introducing the yaml structure and all the possible options that it provides, we are going to describe some concepts: Incident/request/issue: It is a need reported by a customer. It must be handled by an organization following its repective SLA rules. For us every term such as incident, service request, user request and so on will be treated and refered as \"issue\" . TTO: It means Time To Ownership. It is the time it takes for a team or individual to be assigned to an issue after it has been created or its state changed. TTR: It means Time To Resolve. It is the time it takes for an issue to be closed since it has been assigned to someone or a team.","title":"What is a service chain"},{"location":"Specification/#specification","text":"A service chain model description is a YAML document with following structure. Note that primitive data types in the service chain model specification are based on the types supported by the JSON-Schema Draft 4 . Figure 1: SCModel UML Representation. As you can see in Figure 1, SCModel specifications is complex. The UML has different colors to make it easier to understand each part: Grey: This color is used to represent the whole service chain. Purple: This color is used to represent all Enums in SCModel notation. Blue: This color is used to represent all the parts related with SCModel service chain configuration . Light orange: This color is used to represent all the parts related with organizations , including teams, services and people. Pink: This color is used to represent all the parts related with SLAs and objectives.","title":"Specification"},{"location":"Specification/#type-faceted-chains","text":"In service chains with type faceted we have a simplified incident management. In this type of service chains the customer created an issue for its provier. The issue is assigned to a team and later to a person. When this happens, TTO is calculated as the time between its creation and its asignation. Once TTO is calculated, we start to count TTR until the issue has been resolved. Although the issues have states, they are always associated with the same service. If during the issue management the provider organization has to pass the resposability to one of its providers, a new issue between them must be created. In these cases we can close or pause the original issue. This way of managing issues makes a bit difficult tracking whether the first provider or any of its providers are fullfiling the SLAs or not. However, it is simpler and easier to understand. Faceted chains usually are usefull when there are no third party services interacting with the client. We can represent faceted service chains as a directed graph, where the edges always represent a new issue creation. Figure 2: Graph representation of a service chain type faceted chain.","title":"Type faceted chains"},{"location":"Specification/#type-state-chains","text":"In type state service chains issue management is more complex but it is more efficent to detect who is not passing SLAs. In type state, when an issue is created, it has an state, which is related to just one service. In case this service needs to pass the responsability to another, it does it using the same issue, but changing its state. TTO is calculated as the sum of time the issue is not assigned to an user or a team. In case ownership-type is state, TTO is the sum of the times between the issue changes to a new state until is assigned to a person. In case ownership-type is state+team, it is calculated as the sum of the times between the issue is assigned to a new team until is assigned to a person. In type state service chains we must define initial and terminal services, because we can represent this chains as bidirectional graphs. At this point, the only way to determine where we can start or end the process is defining this flow. Here the edges means a issue changing its state. We also need to define an initial SLA, because issue creation is a special moment that just can be done once.
